# Post-SCSM Context

---

**SCSM v11.5.3 — CLOSED**  
Phase I / Phase Ia + 16 declarative toys demonstrated that required structural prerequisites could not be satisfied.

**6-Repository Obstruction Atlas — COMPLETE (December 31, 2025)**  
These same prerequisites are proven **fundamentally unformulable** in background-free, gauge-invariant physics.

## 📊 Historical Arc → Definitive Closure

```
SCSM v6 Ontology → v11.2 Physics → TQEC Mathematics → 16 Toys
↓
120+ Atlas Toys → 6 HARD NO-GO Theorems → FUNDAMENTAL IMPOSSIBLE
↓
RCTF v1.2 → Semiclassical Phenomenology (≈10 pN test)
```

## 🔒 Repository Independence (Strictly Enforced)

**SCSM status**: *Historical motivation ONLY*

- NOT revived  
- NOT a dependency  
- NOT a reference model  
- NOT an assumption  

**Atlas repositories**  
Pure constraint-mapping. Verdicts stand **independently of SCSM**.

**RCTF repository**  
Independent phenomenology operating strictly in the semiclassical regime.

---

## 🎯 Atlas Deliverables

- **Six NO-GO theorems** → arXiv (quant-ph / gr-qc)  
- **Proof**: No fundamental substrate, identity, or persistence  
- **Sole survivor**: RCTF relational tensor (effective phenomenology only)

**Updated January 2026**  
Reflects atlas completion and final RCTF positioning.
