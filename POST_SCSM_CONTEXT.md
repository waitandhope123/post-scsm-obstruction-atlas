# Post-SCSM Context

SCSM v11.5.3 was closed after Phase-I / Phase-Ia when it became clear that the universe,
as currently understood and experimentally accessible, does not support the
structural prerequisites the framework required.

The repositories in this organization do not revive SCSM.
They analyze whether the prerequisites themselves are even possible in principle.

SCSM serves only as historical motivation.
It is not a dependency, reference model, or assumption for any repository.
