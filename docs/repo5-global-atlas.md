# Obstructions
## Repo 5 — Global No-Go Atlas & Feasibility Boundary

This repository does **not** introduce new physical models,
new constructions, or new dynamical claims.

Its sole purpose is to **collect, classify, and unify obstruction results**
identified across Repos 1–4, and to determine which failures are
**fundamental (hard)** versus **contingent (soft)**.

Negative results are treated as **primary data**.

---

## Repository Role

Repo 5 is **not parallel** to Repos 1–4.

It is the **capstone**:

- Repos 1–4 discover failures in specific conceptual domains  
- Repo 5 determines **which failures are actually the same failure**  
- Repo 5 defines the **global feasibility boundary**

This repo answers:
> *Which structures are truly necessary, and which absences are fatal in principle?*

---

## Repository Structure

1. **Calibration** — define what an obstruction is  
2. **Baseline Exclusions** — remove non-fundamental artifacts  
3. **Stress Tests** — combine failures under maximal charity  
4. **Synthesis** — extract global minimal requirements and final boundaries  

Each “toy” is **declarative**, not computational.

---

## Calibration Phase (T01–T05)

Purpose: define obstructions cleanly and prevent false no-go claims.

---

### T01 — Obstruction Definition Calibration
Defines an **obstruction** as a *principle-level impossibility*, not a failed attempt.

Key distinction:
- failure of construction ≠ obstruction of formulation

---

### T02 — Hard vs Soft Obstruction Calibration
Separates obstructions into:
- **HARD** — cannot be formulated even in principle
- **SOFT** — no known construction, but not ruled out

This distinction is enforced globally.

---

### T03 — Assumption-Removal Dependency Calibration
Tracks how obstructions appear as specific assumptions are removed.

Result:
> Many failures are not independent; they share a common root.

---

### T04 — Obstruction Equivalence Class Calibration
Introduces **equivalence classes** of obstructions.

Principle:
> Distinct surface failures may represent the same underlying impossibility.

---

### T05 — Obstruction Taxonomy Calibration
Builds a unified taxonomy spanning:
- locality
- persistence
- relational observables
- error correction
- reference structure
- gauge invariance

No feasibility claims are made yet.

---

## Baseline Exclusions (T06–T10)

Purpose: remove failures that arise from *non-fundamental artifacts*.

---

### T06 — Exclude Model Artifacts
Removes obstructions caused by:
- specific models
- calculational choices
- representation artifacts

Only principle-level failures remain.

---

### T07 — Exclude Effective-Only Failures
Removes failures due solely to:
- finite resolution
- approximations
- practical limitations

Result:
> Effective breakdown ≠ fundamental obstruction.

---

### T08 — Exclude Observer Limitations
Removes failures arising purely from observer access or epistemic limits.

---

### T09 — Exclude Semiclassical Breakdown
Separates breakdowns of approximation from true no-go results.

---

### T10 — Baseline Closure
After exclusions, the remaining obstructions are:
- structural
- assumption-independent
- candidates for hardness testing

---

## Stress Test Phase (T11–T15)

Purpose: test remaining candidates under **combined, maximally charitable conditions**.

---

### T11 — Combined Assumption Stress
Removes multiple assumptions simultaneously.

Result:
> Many candidate obstructions collapse into a small core set.

---

### T12 — Relational / Gauge / Anchor Stress
Tests whether relational constructions evade earlier failures.

Result:
> Relationality relocates structure but does not remove it.

---

### T13 — Time / Subsystem / Boundary Stress
Combines failures from:
- persistence
- locality
- subsystem structure

Result:
> These failures are tightly linked.

---

### T14 — Maximal Charity Stress
Grants every reasonable escape hatch simultaneously.

Result:
> The same core obstructions persist.

---

### T15 — Stress Phase Closure
Identifies a **stable obstruction core** that survives all stress tests.

---

## Synthesis Phase (T16–T20)

Purpose: extract global conclusions.

---

### T16 — Global Minimal Requirements
Extracts structures that must exist for *any* of the following to be meaningful:
- information
- persistence
- locality
- relational observables
- error correction

These include:
- distinguishability
- reference or anchoring structure
- stable identity across configurations
- comparison/retrieval interface
- partial gauge fixing or effective background

---

### T17 — Necessary vs Insufficient Structure
Distinguishes:
- structures that are **necessary**
- structures that are **helpful but insufficient**

No single structure alone resolves all obstructions.

---

### T18 — Final “Only If” Feasibility Boundary
Global conditional statement:

> The above concepts are **only formulable if**
> strong, explicit, non-fundamental scaffolding exists.

---

### T19 — Obstruction Atlas
Collects all HARD obstructions into a unified atlas,
grouped by equivalence class rather than surface manifestation.

---

### T20 — Final Repo Closure
Final result:

**Hard conclusion**
- In strictly background-free, fully gauge-invariant physics,
  the following are **not formulable as fundamental concepts**:
  - locality
  - persistence
  - information storage
  - relational observables
  - error correction

**Conditional permission**
- These concepts survive **only in effective regimes**
  with explicit reference, anchoring, or background structure.

Repo 5 is **closed**.

---

## Global Conclusion (Repos 1–5)

Across five independent investigations, the same result emerges:

> The conceptual infrastructure of physics
> requires structure that is not fundamental.

Future theories must either:
- accept emergent, effective structure explicitly, or
- provide genuinely new mechanisms that evade these obstructions.

No known framework currently does so.
