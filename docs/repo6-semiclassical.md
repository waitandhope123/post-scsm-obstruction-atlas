# Semiclassical vs Fundamental Physics
## Repo 6 — Feasibility & Regime Boundary Mapping

This repository does **not** propose a new theory of quantum gravity,
a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, or a constructive framework.

Its sole purpose is to determine **which informational, dynamical, and narrative
structures are only available in semiclassical or effective regimes**, and which
(if any) survive in fully background-free, gauge-invariant physics.

Negative results are treated as **first-class outcomes**.

---

## Repository Role

Repo 6 isolates the **semiclassical regime itself** as an object of study.

Where earlier repos tested specific concepts (locality, persistence,
relational observables, information), this repo asks:

> *What does the semiclassical regime actually buy us — and what disappears
> when it is removed?*

Repo 6 therefore defines the **regime boundary** between:
- effective / semiclassical physics, and
- fully fundamental, background-free physics.

## Repository Structure

1. **Calibration** — define semiclassical vs fundamental notions precisely  
2. **Baselines** — show what works in semiclassical regimes  
3. **Stress Tests** — remove semiclassical and effective structure  
4. **Synthesis** — extract minimal requirements and feasibility boundaries  

Each “toy” is **declarative**, not computational.

---

## Calibration Phase (T01–T05)

Purpose: eliminate equivocation between *semiclassical*, *effective*,
and *fundamental* claims.

---

### T01 — Semiclassical Definition Calibration
Defines what is meant by:
- semiclassical regime
- effective regime
- fully background-free fundamental regime

Key observation:
> Semiclassical and effective regimes require stabilizing assumptions
> absent from fully gauge-invariant formulations.

---

### T02 — Effective vs Fundamental Distinguishability
Calibrates which notions of state distinguishability exist in each regime.

Result:
> Operational and kinematic distinguishability rely on semiclassical
> stability and measurement access.
> Fully gauge-invariant distinguishability collapses to equivalence classes.

---

### T03 — Semiclassical vs Fundamental Dynamics
Compares classical, relational, and fully invariant notions of dynamics.

Result:
> Trajectories, histories, and evolution rely on time parameters
> and effective stability.
> Fully invariant dynamics lack trajectory-like structure.

---

### T04 — Semiclassical vs Fundamental Records
Calibrates what is required to define records, histories, and “what happened.”

Result:
> Records require stable carriers, ordering, and access.
> Fully invariant labels do not encode historical information.

---

### T05 — Semiclassical Assumption Taxonomy
Enumerates all assumptions used across Repo 6 to support explicit removal
and stress testing.

No claims of fundamentality are made here.

---

## Baseline Phase (T06–T10)

Purpose: demonstrate what **does work** in semiclassical regimes.

---

### T06 — Semiclassical Regime Baseline
Assumes semiclassical stability, effective background, observers,
and stable carriers.

Result:
> Time evolution, distinguishability, records, histories,
> and effective locality are all well-defined.

---

### T07 — Observer-Relative Effective Regime
Shows that even semiclassical coherence is observer-relative.

Result:
> Semiclassical structure already embeds observer dependence.

---

### T08 — Semiclassical Record Stability
Explains why records appear stable in semiclassical physics.

Result:
> Stability arises from suppressed fluctuations and protected carriers,
> not from fundamental principles.

---

### T09 — Emergent Classical Narrative
Shows how classical stories and histories emerge.

Result:
> Narratives require time ordering, stable records,
> and observer-selected coarse-graining.

---

### T10 — Effective-Only Classification
Classifies all successful baseline notions as **EFFECTIVE-ONLY**.

Rule:
> Any concept relying on semiclassical structure, effective background,
> observers, or coarse-graining is not fundamental.

---

## Stress Test Phase (T11–T14)

Purpose: remove semiclassical and effective structure under maximal charity.

---

### T11 — Remove Semiclassical Limit
Removes fluctuation suppression while retaining other structure.

Result:
> Records destabilize, histories decohere,
> narratives and locality collapse.

---

### T12 — Remove Effective Background
Removes background time and geometry.

Result:
> Time evolution, persistence, and history reconstruction
> become undefined.

---

### T13 — Enforce Full Gauge Invariance
Strictly enforces diffeomorphism/gauge invariance.

Result:
> Distinguishability, carriers, records, and observer narratives
> collapse into invariant equivalence classes.

---

### T14 — Combined Fundamental Stress Test
Applies all fundamental constraints simultaneously.

Final result:
> Information, records, memory, dynamics-as-history,
> and classical narratives are **NOT FORMULABLE**.

What remains:
> Invariant equivalence classes with no informational,
> temporal, or historical interpretation.

---

## Synthesis Phase (T15–T20)

Purpose: extract global regime-level conclusions.

---

### T15 — Hard vs Soft Obstruction Map
Classifies failures arising from removing semiclassical structure.

Result:
> Collapse of informational structure is HARD, not contingent.

---

### T16 — Minimal Requirement Set
Extracts minimal atoms required for information, records, and narratives:
- stable distinguishability
- time or ordering
- stable information carriers
- observer or comparison structure
- semiclassical/effective stability
- gauge-invariant formulation

---

### T17 — “Only If Semiclassical / Effective Structure”
Conditional necessity:
> Information, records, dynamics-as-history,
> and classical narratives are ONLY POSSIBLE IF
> a semiclassical or effective stability regime exists.

---

### T18 — Feasibility Boundary
Defines the boundary between semiclassical physics
and fully fundamental physics.

Result:
> Semiclassical physics is not merely an approximation;
> it is a regime with extra structure.

---

### T19 — Obstruction Summary
Summarizes all obstructions identified in Repo 6.

---

### T20 — Final Repo Closure
Final conclusion:

**Hard result**
- In fully background-free, gauge-invariant physics,
  information, records, memory, histories,
  and classical narratives are **not formulable**.

**Conditional permission**
- These structures exist only in semiclassical or effective regimes
  with explicit stabilizing scaffolding.

Repo 6 is **closed**.

---

## Repo 6 Conclusion

The semiclassical regime is not a weak shadow of fundamental physics.
It is a **distinct informational regime** with additional structure.

Any theory claiming fundamental information, memory, or narrative
must explicitly explain how it recreates semiclassical stability
without reintroducing effective background structure.
