# Relational Observables
## Repo 4 — Feasibility & Constraint Mapping

This repository does **not** propose a theory of relational observables,
quantum gravity, or a constructive measurement framework.

Its sole purpose is to determine **whether relational observables can function
as nontrivial, information-bearing physical quantities** in fully
background-free, gauge-invariant physics.

Negative results are treated as **first-class outcomes**.

## Repository Structure

This repo follows the same disciplined structure as Repos 1–3:

1. **Calibration** — eliminate definitional equivocation  
2. **Baselines** — show relational observables work when scaffolding is present  
3. **Stress Tests** — remove scaffolding or enforce invariance  
4. **Synthesis** — map obstructions and state final conditional results  

Each “toy” is **declarative**, not a simulation.

## Calibration Phase (T01–T05)

Purpose: prevent confusion between *relational*, *absolute*, *gauge-fixed*,
and *fully invariant* quantities.

---

### T01 — Relational Observable Definition Calibration
Catalogs common notions of relational observables and records the
assumptions required to even define them.

Key lesson:
> Relational observables are not assumption-free.

---

### T02 — Relational vs Absolute Quantity Calibration
Compares absolute quantities with relational counterparts.

Result:
> Relational quantities avoid fixed backgrounds,  
> but require reference entities and observer correlation.

Fully invariant quantities tend to collapse into labels.

---

### T03 — Relational Observables & Gauge Redundancy
Analyzes how gauge redundancy affects relational observables.

Result:
> Full gauge invariance typically trivializes relational distinctions.

---

### T04 — Relational Observable Trivialization Calibration
Shows how relational observables can lose informational content
even before stress testing.

Result:
> Coarse-graining and invariance reduce relational observables
> to low-information equivalence classes.

---

### T05 — Relational Assumption Registry
Consolidates all assumptions used in defining relational observables
(background, gauge, relational, observer, semiclassical).

No claims are made about fundamentality.

---

## Baseline Phase (T06–T10)

Purpose: demonstrate that relational observables **do work**
when explicit structure is present.

---

### T06 — Relational Observables via Matter Clocks
Uses reference fields (clocks/rods), observers, and gauge fixing.

Result:
> Relational observables are well-defined and operational.

---

### T07 — Partial Gauge Fixing Baseline
Preserves distinguishability by partially fixing gauge redundancy.

Result:
> Relational observables remain nontrivial under partial gauge fixing.

---

### T08 — Semiclassical Relational Observables
Defines relational observables in an effective semiclassical regime.

Result:
> Relational observables are stable and meaningful
> only in effective backgrounds.

---

### T09 — Observer-Relative Relational Observables
Shows relational observables remain observer-dependent.

Result:
> Relationality shifts, but does not eliminate, observer dependence.

---

### T10 — Effective-Only Classification
Classifies all baseline relational observables as **effective-only**.

Rule:
> Any relational observable relying on reference fields, observers,
> gauge fixing, or semiclassical structure is not fundamental.

---

## Stress Test Phase (T11–T15)

Purpose: remove scaffolding or enforce full physical constraints.

---

### T11 — Remove Reference Fields
Removes rods, clocks, and relational anchors.

Result:
> Relational observables collapse without anchors.

---

### T12 — Enforce Full Gauge Invariance
Requires only fully gauge-invariant quantities to count.

Result:
> Relational observables either collapse or trivialize.

---

### T13 — Dynamical Drift of Relational Observables
Allows relational anchors to evolve dynamically.

Result:
> Relational observables drift and lose stable identity.

---

### T14 — Coarse-Graining Failure
Imposes finite resolution and coarse-graining.

Result:
> Coarse-graining erases distinctions required for information.

---

### T15 — Relational Information Dissolution
Combines all stress conditions.

Result:
> Relational observables fail:
> - stable identity  
> - retrievability  
> - distinguishability  
> - persistence under dynamics  

What remains are invariant labels, not information.

---

## Synthesis Phase (T16–T20)

Purpose: consolidate results into explicit feasibility statements.

---

### T16 — Minimal Requirement Set
Extracts minimal atoms required for relational observables
to function as information:
- stable distinguishability  
- reference or anchoring structure  
- observer or comparison framework  
- persistence under dynamics  
- nontrivial informational capacity  
- gauge-invariant formulation  

---

### T17 — “Only If Reference / Anchor Structure”
Conditional necessity:
> Relational observables function as information
> **only if** anchoring structures exist.

---

### T18 — “Only If Semiclassical / Effective Regime”
Conditional necessity:
> Relational observables function as information
> **only if** an effective or semiclassical regime exists.

---

### T19 — Hard vs Soft Obstruction Map
Classifies obstructions as:
- **HARD** — principle-level collapse
- **SOFT** — logically possible but unrealized

---

### T20 — Final Scope-Limited Conclusion
Final outcome:

**Hard result**
- In strictly background-free, fully gauge-invariant physics,
  relational observables are **not formulable** as information.

**Conditional permission**
- Relational observables function only with strong,
  non-fundamental scaffolding
  (anchors, observers, effective regimes).

---

## Repo 4 Conclusion

Relational observables do **not** provide a fundamental escape
from background dependence for information, memory, or locality.

They emerge only in effective regimes with substantial scaffolding.

Repo 4 is **closed**.
