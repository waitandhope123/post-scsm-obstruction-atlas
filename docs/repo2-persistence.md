# Background-Free Persistence
## Repo 2 — Feasibility & Constraint Mapping

This repository does **not** propose a theory of memory, information storage,
or persistence.

Its sole purpose is to determine **whether persistence-as-information is even
*formulable*** in fully background-free, gauge-invariant physics.

Negative results are treated as **first-class outcomes**.

---

## Repository Structure

The repo follows the same disciplined structure as Repo 1:

1. **Calibration** — eliminate definitional equivocation  
2. **Baselines** — show persistence works when scaffolding is present  
3. **Stress Tests** — remove scaffolding or enforce invariance  
4. **Synthesis** — map obstructions and state final conditional results  

Each “toy” is **declarative**, not a simulation.

---

## Calibration Phase (T01–T05)

Purpose: prevent confusion between *existence*, *identity*, *invariance*, and
*informational persistence*.

---

### T01 — Persistence Definition Calibration
Catalogs candidate meanings of “persistent information” and records the
assumptions required to even state them.

Key lesson:
> Different definitions of persistence rely on different hidden structures.

---

### T02 — Trivial Invariant False-Positive Calibration
Demonstrates that invariant quantities (charges, sectors, labels) do **not**
constitute nontrivial persistent information.

Minimal screening criteria for persistence:
1. Distinguishability
2. Retrievability / comparison
3. Non-vacuous informational content

Result:
> Invariance alone ≠ memory.

---

### T03 — Identity vs Retrievability Calibration
Separates:
- persistence as “identity over time”
- persistence as retrievable information

Result:
> Identity without retrievability collapses into trivial existence.

---

### T04 — Gauge Averaging Effect Calibration
Shows that enforcing full gauge invariance via averaging generically erases
distinguishability and collapses persistence.

Result:
> Gauge invariance + averaging destroys informational persistence.

---

### T05 — Persistence Assumption Registry
Builds an explicit taxonomy of assumptions commonly used in persistence claims
(time, observers, reference frames, distinguishability, relational scaffolding).

No claims are made about fundamentality.

---

## Baseline Phase (T06–T10)

Purpose: show that persistence **does work** when strong structure is explicitly present.

---

### T06 — Fixed Time Reference Baseline
Assumes time, observer, retrieval, and distinguishability.

Result:
> Persistence is well-defined and unproblematic.

---

### T07 — External Memory Register Baseline
Outsources persistence to an explicit external memory/register.

Result:
> Persistence is robust when stored in stable external structures.

---

### T08 — Relational Clock Construction Baseline
Defines persistence relationally using an internal clock degree of freedom.

Result:
> Avoids absolute time, but still requires distinguishability and observers.

---

### T09 — Semiclassical Observer-Dependent Baseline
Defines persistence in a semiclassical regime relative to observers.

Result:
> Persistence exists as an effective, observer-dependent notion.

---

### T10 — Effective-Only Persistence Classification
Classifies all surviving baseline notions as **effective-only**.

Rule:
> Any persistence notion relying on time, observers, retrieval, or
> distinguishability is effective, not fundamental.

---

## Stress Test Phase (T11–T15)

Purpose: remove baseline scaffolding or enforce invariance constraints.

---

### T11 — Remove Fixed Time
Removes all time or ordering structure.

Result:
> Without time or ordering, persistence is undefined.

---

### T12 — Remove Reference Frames / Observers
Removes observers and retrieval interfaces.

Result:
> Persistence collapses into uninterpreted existence.

---

### T13 — Enforce Full Gauge Invariance
Requires only fully gauge-invariant quantities to count as physical.

Result:
> Distinguishability and identity tracking collapse.

---

### T14 — Dynamic Geometry Information Loss
Makes geometry fully dynamical.

Result:
> Stable information carriers become generically unstable.

---

### T15 — Identity Indistinguishability
Enforces gauge invariance + dynamical structure.

Result:
> Identity collapses into vacuous equivalence classes.
> Persistence-as-information is no longer meaningful.

---

## Synthesis Phase (T16–T20)

Purpose: consolidate results into explicit feasibility statements.

---

### T16 — Minimal Requirement Set
Extracts the minimal atoms required for persistence-as-information:
- time or ordering
- distinguishability
- retrieval/comparison
- reference structure
- stable carriers
- gauge-invariant formulation

---

### T17 — “Only If Reference Structure”
Conditional necessity:
> Persistence-as-information is only possible if some reference or observer
> structure exists.

---

### T18 — “Only If Semiclassical Limit”
Conditional necessity:
> Persistence-as-information survives only in effective regimes
> (typically semiclassical).

---

### T19 — Hard vs Soft Obstruction Map
Classifies obstructions as:
- **HARD** — definitional or principle-level collapse
- **SOFT** — no known construction, but not proven impossible

---

### T20 — Final Scope-Limited Conclusion
Final outcome:

**Hard result**
- In strictly background-free, gauge-invariant physics,
  persistence-as-information is **not formulable**.

**Conditional permission**
- Persistence exists only with strong, non-fundamental scaffolding
  (time, observers, reference structures, distinguishability, carriers).

---

## Repo 2 Conclusion

Persistence-as-information is **not a fundamental concept** in known
background-free formulations of physics.

It emerges only in effective regimes with substantial structural scaffolding.

Any future theory invoking fundamental memory or persistence must explicitly
evade or accept these constraints.
