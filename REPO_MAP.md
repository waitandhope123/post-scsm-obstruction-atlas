# Repository Map

This document describes the purpose and scope of each repository in the program.  
Each repository addresses a single structural prerequisite and its feasibility  
under background-free physics.

## Repo 1 — Quantum Gravity Error Correction (QGEC)

**Working Title**  
*Quantum Gravity Error Correction: Possibility and Obstructions*

**Why This Exists**  
SCSM required information to be protected by spacetime itself.  
Error correction is the only known mechanism for such protection.  
However, error correction assumes fixed locality and a stable code subspace.

**Core Question**  
Can error-correction–like protection exist when spacetime is dynamical and  
background-free?

**What This Repo Analyzes**
- Known results in holographic error correction
- Structural assumptions required for error correction
- What breaks under full diffeomorphism invariance
- Whether “noise” and “protection” are definable without background structure

**What Success Looks Like**
- A clean no-go result, or
- A sharply constrained conditional viability statement

**Why It Matters**  
If QGEC is impossible, all SCSM-like theories are impossible in principle.

## Repo 2 — Background-Free Protected Information

**Working Title**  
*Protected Information Without Background Structure*

**Why This Exists**  
SCSM assumed persistence could be an invariant of reality.  
In GR and quantum gravity, most quantities are gauge-relative and observer-dependent.

**Core Question**  
Can any nontrivial information persist invariantly without fixed spacetime, time,  
or reference frames?

**What This Repo Analyzes**
- Definitions of information in GR and quantum gravity
- Relational observables and gauge-invariant quantities
- Known no-go theorems for invariant storage
- Whether persistence is definable or meaningless fundamentally

**What Success Looks Like**
- Proof that invariant persistence is impossible, or
- Identification of extremely narrow invariant structures

**Why It Matters**  
If background-free persistence is undefined, identity or memory cannot be  
fundamental physical concepts.

## Repo 3 — Diffeomorphism-Invariant Locality

**Working Title**  
*Locality Without Coordinates: Constraints from Diffeomorphism Invariance*

**Why This Exists**  
SCSM relied on local perturbations, boundaries, and interfaces.  
In GR, locality is coordinate-dependent and not invariant.

**Core Question**  
Can “local disturbance” or “boundary” be defined invariantly in a  
background-free universe?

**What This Repo Analyzes**
- Local versus relational observables in GR
- Quasi-local constructions and their limits
- Whether “local noise” is invariantly meaningful
- Consequences for boundary-based reasoning

**What Success Looks Like**
- Demonstration that locality collapses fundamentally, or
- Identification of a viable quasi-local substitute

**Why It Matters**  
If locality is not invariant, boundary-based phenomenology is meaningless.

## Repo 4 — Relational Observables & Gauge Invariance

**Working Title**  
*Relational Observables and the Limits of Gauge-Invariant Information*

**Core Question**  
What kinds of observables survive full gauge redundancy, and are they stable?

**What This Repo Analyzes**
- Construction of relational observables
- Stability under dynamics and coarse-graining
- Whether relational quantities can encode persistence

**Why It Matters**  
Defines what information could even be observable in any future theory.

## Repo 5 — No-Go Theorems & Obstruction Atlas

**Working Title**  
*Obstructions to Protected Information in Fundamental Physics*

**Core Question**  
Which structures are forbidden in principle, and why?

**What This Repo Analyzes**
- Known no-go theorems across GR, QFT, and information theory
- Soft versus hard impossibilities
- Consolidated obstruction mapping

**Why It Matters**  
Prevents future theories from unknowingly rebuilding forbidden structures.

## Repo 6 — Semiclassical vs Fundamental Regime

**Working Title**  
*Which Structures Survive Beyond the Semiclassical Limit?*

**Core Question**  
Which notions persist beyond semiclassical approximations?

**What This Repo Analyzes**
- Breakdown of locality and protection beyond semiclassical regimes
- Artifacts of approximation versus fundamental features

**Why It Matters**  
Prevents overinterpreting effective models as fundamental truths.

## Trajectory Summary

SCSM asked: *“Can a theory like this exist in our universe?”*  
These repositories ask: *“Does physics permit any theory like this at all?”*

If future theory-building occurs, it must be derived from the results of these  
repositories.  
If not, the idea-space closes cleanly and honestly.

**Status**  
**SCSM — CLOSED**
