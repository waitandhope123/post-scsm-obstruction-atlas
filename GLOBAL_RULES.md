# Global Rules

These rules apply to all repositories in this organization.

- These are constraint-mapping projects, not theories.
- Negative results are first-class outcomes.
- No phenomenology, no experiments, no ontology.
- Language must be precise, conservative, and scope-limited.
- SCSM is historical motivation only and never a dependency.

Violations of these rules invalidate contributions.
