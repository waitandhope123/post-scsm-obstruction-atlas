# Global Rules

**These rules apply to ALL repositories in this organization.  
Violations invalidate contributions.**

---

## 🎯 Core Scope

✅ **Constraint-mapping ONLY**  
120+ declarative toys mapping what is *formulable* in strict physics.

✅ **Negative results = FIRST-CLASS outcomes**  
Six HARD NO-GO theorems are the primary deliverable.

✅ **Historical arc acknowledged**  
SCSM → Obstruction Atlas → RCTF phenomenological survivor.

❌ **NO** new theories, mechanisms, or fundamental ontologies  
❌ **NO** empirical validation or experimental claims  
❌ **NO** phenomenological interpretation beyond RCTF scoping  
❌ **NO** revival or extension of SCSM (historical motivation ONLY; program closed)

## 📝 Language Requirements

### MUST USE

- “not formulable”
- “HARD NO-GO”
- “effective-only”
- “conditional permission”
- “requires scaffolding”
- Explicit **T20 verdicts** from the relevant repository

### NEVER USE

- “proves X exists”
- “theory of Y”
- “explains Z”
- “fundamental mechanism”
- Unqualified “consciousness substrate”

Precision language is mandatory.  
Ambiguity is treated as a scope violation.

## 🔬 Atlas Positioning

**ATLAS VERDICT**  
Fundamental consciousness substrates are **IMPOSSIBLE**.

**SOLE SURVIVOR**  
RCTF v1.2 — semiclassical phenomenology only  
Single quantitative prediction: **ΔF ≈ 10 pN**

**STRUCTURE**  
6 repositories → unified obstruction proof → 1 testable prediction

---

## 📋 Repository Compliance

- **Every repository** MUST link `docs/SUMMARY.md`
- **Every document** MUST cite its relevant T20 conclusion
- **No repository** may propose alternatives to atlas verdicts
- **RCTF repository** maintains a strictly separate phenomenological scope

Noncompliance = invalid contribution.

## ✅ Program Status

**Obstruction Atlas**: CLOSED — December 31, 2025 (6/6 repositories complete)  
**RCTF**: ACTIVE — experimental outreach (cryo-AFM, ~10 pN regime)

---

**Updated January 2026**  
Atlas completed. RCTF positioned. Scope locked.
