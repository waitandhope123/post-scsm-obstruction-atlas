# post-scsm-obstruction-atlas
Constraint-mapping analyses of structural obstructions to protected, persistent information in background-free physics. Post-closure successor to the SCSM program. These repositories do not propose theories or phenomenology; they identify no-go results, feasibility limits, and definitional failures.
