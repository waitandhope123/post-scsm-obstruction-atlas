# Foundational Constraint-Mapping Projects

This organization hosts a set of independent research repositories that analyze
whether certain structural prerequisites are permitted by fundamental physics.

These projects do not propose new theories. They map feasibility boundaries for
protected information, locality, and persistence in background-free physics.

Negative results are first-class outcomes.
