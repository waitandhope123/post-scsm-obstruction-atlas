# Program Scope

## Goal

Map the feasibility space for **protected information** in background-free physics.

These projects determine whether physics permits any theory in the spirit of SCSM
to exist at all, independent of specific models or phenomenology.

## Guiding Question

Does fundamental physics allow for invariantly protected, persistent information
without fixed spacetime structure?

## What Counts as Success

- A clean no-go result  
- A sharply constrained “only possible if X” result  
- A demonstration that a concept is undefined or ill-posed at the fundamental level  

## What This Program Is Not

- Not a theory-building effort  
- Not phenomenology  
- Not experimental design  
- Not ontology or metaphysics  

These are feasibility and obstruction analyses only.
