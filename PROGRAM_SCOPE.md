# Program Scope

---

## 🎯 Goal — ACHIEVED

**6-Repository Obstruction Atlas**  
Proven: **fundamental consciousness substrates are impossible** in background-free physics.  
**COMPLETE — December 31, 2025**

**→ Verdict overview:** [`REPOSITORY_MAP.md`](../REPOSITORY_MAP.md)  
**→ Full proof:** [`docs/SUMMARY.md`](../docs/SUMMARY.md)

## 📊 Historical Guiding Question → Answer

**QUESTION**  
Does fundamental physics permit invariantly protected, persistent information  
without fixed spacetime structure?

**ANSWER**  
**NO.**  
HARD NO-GO results across **six independent domains**, via **120+ declarative toys**.

---

## ✅ What Success Looks Like (Delivered)

✓ Six clean **NO-GO theorems**  
✓ Explicit **“effective-only” conditional permissions**  
✓ Six foundational concepts proven **ill-posed at the fundamental level**  
✓ **RCTF v1.2** positioned as the **sole phenomenological survivor**

## ❌ What This Program Is NOT (Strictly Enforced)

❌ Theory-building  
❌ General phenomenology (except RCTF scoping)  
❌ Experimental design (except the RCTF prediction)  
❌ Ontology or metaphysics  
❌ Fundamental claims of existence or mechanism  

**Feasibility analysis ONLY.**

## 📈 Status & Next

✅ **PROGRAM SCOPE** — CLOSED (Atlas complete)  
✅ **SCSM / TQEC** — CLOSED (historical motivation only)  
✅ **OBSTRUCTION ATLAS** — CLOSED (6/6 repositories complete)  
🔄 **RCTF v1.2** — ACTIVE (≈10 pN experimental test)

**Updated January 2026**  
Reflects atlas completion and final RCTF positioning.
