# Diffeomorphism-Invariant Locality
## Repo 3 — Feasibility & Constraint Mapping

This repository does **not** propose a theory of locality,
a quantum gravity model, or a constructive framework.

Its sole purpose is to determine **whether locality is even *formulable***
as a physical, gauge-invariant concept in fully
background-free, diffeomorphism-invariant physics.

Negative results are treated as **first-class outcomes**.

## Repository Structure

This repo follows the same disciplined structure as Repo 1 and Repo 2:

1. **Calibration** — eliminate definitional ambiguity  
2. **Baselines** — show locality works when scaffolding is present  
3. **Stress Tests** — remove scaffolding or enforce invariance  
4. **Synthesis** — map obstructions and state final conditional results  

Each “toy” is **declarative**, not a simulation.

## Calibration Phase (T01–T05)

Purpose: prevent equivocation between coordinate locality,
metric locality, relational locality, and boundary-defined notions.

---

### T01 — Locality Definition Calibration
Catalogs common notions of locality and records the assumptions
required to even state them.

Key lesson:
> Different locality notions rely on different background structures.

---

### T02 — Coordinate Dependence Calibration
Shows that most familiar locality notions depend on coordinates
or gauge fixing.

Result:
> Coordinate-local support is not diffeomorphism-invariant.

---

### T03 — Distance vs Relational Locality Calibration
Separates distance-based locality from purely relational notions.

Result:
> Distance-based locality presupposes metric structure;  
> purely relational locality is weak and observer-dependent.

---

### T04 — Boundary Concept Dependency Calibration
Analyzes what is required to define boundaries, interfaces, or edges.

Result:
> Boundary notions presuppose region structure, factorization,
> coordinates, or anchoring.

---

### T05 — Locality Assumption Taxonomy
Consolidates all assumptions used across locality notions into
a single explicit registry.

No claims are made about fundamentality.

---

## Baseline Phase (T06–T10)

Purpose: show that locality **does work** when strong structure is
explicitly present.

---

### T06 — Fixed Background Neighborhoods
Assumes fixed geometry, coordinates, metric structure, regions,
and observer access.

Result:
> Standard locality notions (neighborhoods, boundaries,
> local disturbances) are well-defined.

---

### T07 — Quasi-Local Construction
Examines quasi-local notions that relax strict locality.

Result:
> Quasi-local notions still rely on metric structure,
> region definitions, gauge fixing, and observers.

---

### T08 — Matter Reference Fields
Uses matter fields as rods, clocks, or anchors.

Result:
> Reference fields relocate background structure into matter;
> they do not eliminate it.

---

### T09 — Semiclassical Local Disturbance
Defines locality in a semiclassical regime.

Result:
> Locality exists as an effective, observer-relative notion.

---

### T10 — Effective-Only Locality Classification
Classifies all baseline locality notions as **effective-only**.

Rule:
> Any locality notion relying on background, anchoring,
> observers, or semiclassical structure is not fundamental.

---

## Stress Test Phase (T11–T15)

Purpose: remove scaffolding or enforce diffeomorphism invariance.

---

### T11 — Remove Fixed Background / Coordinates
Makes geometry dynamical and removes coordinate meaning.

Result:
> Neighborhoods, regions, and local disturbance lose invariant meaning.

---

### T12 — Remove Region Decomposition / Fixed Metric
Removes stable metric and region structure.

Result:
> Distance-based locality, boundaries, and local disturbance
> become unformulable.

---

### T13 — Enforce Full Diffeomorphism Invariance
Requires only invariant statements to count as physical.

Result:
> Coordinate locality, region decomposition, and boundaries
> lose invariant status.

---

### T14 — Relational Disturbance Instability
Tests relational locality under dynamical geometry.

Result:
> Relational localization is unstable without added scaffolding.

---

### T15 — Boundary as Gauge Artifact
Examines boundary notions under full gauge invariance.

Result:
> Boundaries and interfaces are gauge-relative artifacts
> without anchoring structures.

---

## Synthesis Phase (T16–T20)

Purpose: consolidate results into explicit feasibility statements.

---

### T16 — Minimal Requirement Set
Extracts minimal atoms required to even formulate locality:
- stable distinguishability
- region-like or equivalent structure
- definable disturbance/interface
- identifiable boundaries
- reference or observer structure
- gauge-invariant formulation

---

### T17 — “Only If Quasi-Local / Equivalent Structure”
Conditional necessity:
> Locality is only possible if some stable region-like
> or equivalent structure exists.

---

### T18 — “Only If Reference / Anchoring Structure”
Conditional necessity:
> Locality is only possible if some invariant anchoring
> or reference structure stabilizes regions and interfaces.

---

### T19 — Hard vs Soft Obstruction Map
Classifies obstructions as:
- **HARD** — principle-level collapse
- **SOFT** — no known construction, but not ruled out

---

### T20 — Final Scope-Limited Conclusion
Final outcome:

**Hard result**
- In strictly background-free, fully diffeomorphism-invariant physics,
  locality is **not formulable** as a fundamental concept.

**Conditional permission**
- Locality survives only if strong, non-fundamental scaffolding exists
  (regions, anchors, reference structures).

---

## Repo 3 Conclusion

Locality is **not fundamental** in known background-free formulations.

It emerges only in effective or semiclassical regimes
with substantial structural scaffolding.

Repo 3 is **closed**.
